# Introduction

### Thank You!

> Before you go any further, all of us at SimplePlatformer want to thank you for thinking about contributing. It's people like you that make our open-source examplar of Godot so great.

### Why Should I Read This?

> Following these guidelines will help developers save time and effort, and in turn will allow your valuable changes and contributions to receive the attention they deserve.

### What Are We Looking For?

> SimplePlatformer is an example of how to use Godot to build a simple platformer. As such, if you have any ideas that showcase Godot's tools within the scope of a simple project (feature requests), bug reports, or documentation suggestions, please consider contributing.

### What Are We NOT Looking For?

> The Issue Tracker is for feature requests and bug reports. Please keep questions in our #support channel on Discord.

# Ground Rules
> Responsibilities
> * Ensure that all submitted code is tested and works before creating a pull request.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to SimplePlatformer? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### New to Contributing to Open-Source Software?
Here is a friendly tutorial:
> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

> At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first!

> If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### Tests

* Here's how to do tests:
* [Test Steps]

### Forking

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request!

### "Obvious" (But Still Useful) Fixes

>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# Security
### If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@simpleplatformer.net instead.

> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>   
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at the above email. Thanks!

# Bug Reports
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Godot are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
>
> Finally, it helps to list the steps to reproduce the bug.

# Features
### SimplePlatformer

> The goal of SimplePlatformer is to provide a simple example for how to use Godot's engine for 2D games.

### Suggesting a Feature

> If you find yourself with questions on how to use Godot for 2D games but use SimplePlatformer, you are probably not alone. Open a feature request with the permission of a developer in #support on our Discord.

# Code Review Process

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Zoom meeting. The meeting is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the #updates channel in Discord. Notes are posted to the #notes channel and include a link to a YouTube recording of the meeting.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on [Discord Link]. We try to have office hours on Fridays.
